# CS111_VonKockSnowflake

by Alex Olson and Kiya Goveck
Fall 2014

In this assignment, my partner Kiya Goveck and I wrote a recursive function to generate the von Kock Snowflake. One way to think about a von Kock snowflake is as follows: you start with a triangle, and then for every line in the triangle, you replace it by a four-line piece. Then you repeat the same process on the resulting lines, and do it again, and again. The 'level' of a fractal is the number of times you repeat this "expansion" process.
